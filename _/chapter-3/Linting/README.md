# Linting Example

This is a basic demonstration of how to use an ES6 linter. Use `npm install` to install dependencies. If you haven't yet set up Node.js, please consult the official [documentation](https://nodejs.org/).  

Consult your editor's documentation on how to install a linting plugin. For example, here is the [Atom plugin](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-eslint).
